CROP YIELD PREDICTION MODEL - EVALUATION METRICS
============================================================

REGRESSION METRICS:
------------------------------------------------------------
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination): 0.9576
  - Interpretation: 95.76% of variance in yield is explained by the model
  - Range: [0, 1], Higher is better

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.1002
  - Average absolute difference between actual and predicted yield
  - Lower is better

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 16140.3554
  - Average squared difference between actual and predicted yield
  - Lower is better

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 127.0447
  - Square root of MSE, in same units as target variable
  - Lower is better

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 2.57%
  - Average percentage error
  - Lower is better

DATASET STATISTICS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Mean Yield: 39.9184 tons/hectare
Number of test samples: 47768
